Introduction
Python for Beginners is an educational app built with Flutter that allows users to explore Python programming in a structured and interactive way. The app includes a wide range of Python programs categorized by different programming concepts. Each program comes with a code snippet and an option for users to input their data to see how the program executes.

Features
Categorized Python Programs: Explore various Python programs grouped into categories like Strings, Variables, Lists, Sorting, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and other core concepts.

Interactive Coding Environment: Users can modify and execute Python programs within the app, providing a hands-on learning experience.

User Input Functionality: Many programs allow users to input their values, enabling them to experiment with the code and understand how it operates.

Real-time Output: See the output of your Python code immediately after execution, helping you to learn and debug effectively.

Simple and Clean UI: The app is designed with a user-friendly interface to make navigation and learning seamless.
